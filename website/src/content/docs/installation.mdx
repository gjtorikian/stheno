# Installation

Stheno is distributed as several packages to fit different use cases.

## Core Package

The core package provides the base CodeMirror configuration:

```bash
npm install @yettoapp/stheno @codemirror/state @codemirror/view
```

### Peer Dependencies

Stheno requires CodeMirror 6 as peer dependencies:

- `@codemirror/state` - Editor state management
- `@codemirror/view` - Editor view and DOM handling

## Framework Packages

Choose the package that matches your framework:

### React

```bash
npm install @yettoapp/stheno-react
```

The React package includes `@yettoapp/stheno` as a dependency, so you only need to install the CodeMirror peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @yettoapp/stheno-react @codemirror/state @codemirror/view
```

### Vue

```bash
npm install @yettoapp/stheno-vue @codemirror/state @codemirror/view
```

### Svelte

```bash
npm install @yettoapp/stheno-svelte @codemirror/state @codemirror/view
```

## TypeScript Support

All packages include TypeScript declarations out of the box. No additional `@types/*` packages are needed.

## Browser Support

Stheno supports all modern browsers that CodeMirror 6 supports:

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## CDN Usage

While not recommended for production, you can use Stheno via CDN for quick prototyping:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { EditorView } from "https://esm.sh/@codemirror/view";
  import { EditorState } from "https://esm.sh/@codemirror/state";
  import { getSthenoConfig } from "https://esm.sh/@yettoapp/stheno";

  const view = new EditorView({
    parent: document.getElementById("editor"),
    state: EditorState.create(getSthenoConfig("markdown")),
  });
</script>
```
