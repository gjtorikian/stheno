# Getting Started

Stheno is an opinionated CodeMirror configuration that provides a powerful markdown editing experience out of the box.

## Installation

Install Stheno along with its peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install @yettoapp/stheno @codemirror/state @codemirror/view
```

## Basic Usage

Create an editor with the default configuration:

```typescript
import { EditorView } from "@codemirror/view";
import { EditorState } from "@codemirror/state";
import { getSthenoConfig, setupThemeListener } from "@yettoapp/stheno";

// Create the editor
const view = new EditorView({
  parent: document.getElementById("editor"),
  state: EditorState.create(getSthenoConfig("markdown")),
});

// Enable automatic dark/light mode switching based on system preference
setupThemeListener(view);
```
